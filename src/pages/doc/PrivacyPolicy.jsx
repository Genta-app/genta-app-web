    </p>

    <p>This policy is effective as of 30 September 2022.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided”
      information and “automatically collected” information.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and
      actively provide us when using or participating in any of our services.

      “Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically
      sent by your devices in the course of accessing our services.
    </p>

      browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit,
      the time spent on each page, and other details about your visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may automatically
      collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data
      may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error
      happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not
      receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred,
      or what the nature of the error is.
    </p>

      Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself,
      it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.

      user-generated content is associated with the account or email address used to submit the
      materials.
    </p>


    <p>
      Please be aware that content you submit may become available to other individuals. This
      can happen when you choose to share your content with other users. Once shared, the content

      so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to

        secure, and used in line with our terms of use
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with
      general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, If
      you provide us with your location, we may combine this with general information about currency
      and language to provide you with an enhanced experience of our site and service.
    </p>

    <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
      When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information,
      we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well
      as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we
      advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one
      can guarantee absolute data security.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring
      the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example,
      ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts are
      secure and confidential.
    </p>

    <h2>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
      We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may
      depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy.
      For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of creating an
      account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on
      our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will
      delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a
      legal, accounting, or reporting obligation.

      information, and you are under 16 years of age, we will seek your parent or legal
      guardian’s consent to process your personal information for that specific purpose.
    </p>

    <p>

      delete your personal information within 90 days of the deletion of your account. Please be
      aware that search engines and similar third parties may still retain copies of your personal
      information that has been made public at least once, e.g. by sharing a public link to a
